Fantastic—thanks for sharpening the focus! You want a Product Requirements Document (PRD) that covers both a robust company website and a high-converting landing page. I’ll lean into clear, actionable requirements for your web development/design team, with emphasis on lead capture, credibility, and great UX.

To give you the best possible PRD, I'll need a few extra details. (Feel free to answer now, or I'll make reasonable assumptions and mention where you should fill in the blanks.)

Primary audience: B2B, B2C, or a specific sector (tech startups, SMEs, etc.)?
Main conversion action: Is it contact form submission, demo request, email signup, quote request?
Key differentiators: What makes your company or solution unique?
Must-have integrations: (Email automation, analytics, chatbots, CRM, etc.)
Design requirements: (Brand colors, typography, tone, accessibility?)
Deadline/urgency: (Are you aiming for an MVP sprint, or a pixel-perfect launch?)
Here’s how I’ll structure your PRD:
[Product/Feature Name: Company Website + High-Converting Landing Page]
TL;DR:
Build a dynamic and visually polished website—including a dedicated, conversion-optimized landing page—to establish brand credibility, showcase services, and drive high-quality leads. Targeted at [insert audience type], the site delivers compelling content, seamless UX, and streamlined lead capture.

[Example]
Frustrated after endless agency websites with bland features and cluttered forms, Lisa (a startup CTO) clicks your paid ad and lands on a sleek, to-the-point page. The headline speaks directly to her needs, testimonials give her confidence, and a short, no-BS form promises quick follow-up—she submits, receives a warm thank you message, and books a call the same day. Two weeks later, she's a client—impressed by credibility, speed, and delightful UX.
